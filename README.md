# 5. Features / Highlights

Business Problem
E-commerce data often sits across multiple tables, making it difficult to quickly answer operational questions like:
- Which products generate the most revenue or profit?
- How do sales vary by customer segment or region?
- What trends are emerging month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter?
- Where can profitability be improved?

- Goal of the Dashboard: To create an analytical workspace that visualizes key KPIs, uncovers product performance patterns, tracks sales and profit trends over time, highlights regional strengths and weaknesses, and supports strategic decisions across pricing, marketing, and inventory.
